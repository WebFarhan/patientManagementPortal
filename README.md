Patient management portal

This application is built using React with TypeScript, leveraging several key technologies:

React (v18.3.1) - Core framework for building the user interface
Vite - Build tool and development server
TypeScript - For type safety and better development experience
Tailwind CSS - For styling and responsive design
React Router - For handling navigation and routing
Lucide React - For icons and visual elements
The tech stack is modern and production-ready, offering:

Fast development with Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
Type safety with TypeScript
Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
Component-based architecture with React
Clean routing with React Router
Consistent iconography with Lucide React
You can see these dependencies in the package.json file, which shows the exact versions being used. The application follows best practices for React development, including:

Proper state management with React hooks
Protected routes for authentication
Responsive layouts
Type-safe components
Modern styling approaches
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the architecture or show you how certain features are implemented?
